###A TYPO3 Blog Extension

###Important Notes
There are still some problems with the commenting section an TYPO3 6.2.1 - the Ajax EID Dispatcher ist not 
(stabel) working. I will change this in the next days ...

I started to include the fronted Blog editing - actual the functions for editing posts and categories are implemented. All other stuff must be done via Backend.
 
**New Features in this Version:**
* one blog post contains several content parts (with image options)
* Ajax / EID for Comments
* n:m Category Relations, FAL for Images
* SEO Fields and Meta-Tags for Blog and Posts
* Share Buttons for facebook, google+ and twitter
* Ready for TYPO3 6.2 !

**Basis Features**
* Usable as single blog or multiple blogs in one installation
* Complete Frontend editing of the blogs through blog owner
* Commenting system included
* Continuous development
* Since 2 years in production enviroment with 20 blogs an over 1.000 posts in one installation
